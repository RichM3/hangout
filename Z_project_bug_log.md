1) CSS styling - a few hangups
-- adding the image to the window
-- styling the header using margins and padding and id when to use % vs fixed values
-- rounding buttons and images
-- creating a dropdown list on hover over


2) Added email to login form and forgot to add email to strong: user_params to display on group page - had to waterfall debug to find the issue.  

3) Clear session errors to remove them from passing from login to signup forms.
-- Had to create a action creator and an ajax action creator and a new case statment to my reducer and a componentWillUnmount method to the react component
